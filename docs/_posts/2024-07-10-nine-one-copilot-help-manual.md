## Quick Start Guide
Getting Started with Nine One Copilot

Welcome to Nine One Copilot, your powerful AI assistant for Windows and Mac computers! This quick guide will help you get started with using Nine One Copilot and exploring the world of AI at your fingertips.

### Setting Up Your User Data Directory

When you first launch Nine One Copilot, it will ask you to set up a user data directory. This is where all your personal data and settings will be stored. Choose a location that you can easily access and remember, as you'll need it later.

### Connecting to AI Models

Nine One Copilot lets you work with various AI models from different providers, such as OpenAI, Moonshot, and Qwen. To connect to these models, you'll need to provide their respective API keys. Each provider has its own way of obtaining and setting up API keys, so we'll cover the specific steps for each provider in later sections of this guide.

### Exploring Available Models

Once you've connected to your chosen AI models, you can browse the list of available models within Nine One Copilot. This will give you an overview of the different AI capabilities you can access and utilize.

### Creating Conversations and Interacting with AI

This is where you'll type your prompts, questions, or instructions for the AI to process and respond to. Nine One Copilot will act as your intermediary, sending your requests to the selected AI model and displaying the responses back to you.

With these basic steps, you're ready to embark on your AI journey using Nine One Copilot. Remember, this is just the beginning – there's a whole world of AI possibilities waiting to be explored!
